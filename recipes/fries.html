        <h1>CRISPY FRIES</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, here it is – the perfect french fries recipe! Based on a ground-breaking method from the legendary Kenji López-Alt’s The Food Lab,
            these hot chips are so crispy they stay that way even after they’ve gone cold. It’s rare to find fries this good even at up-market bistros!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potato
                <ul>
                    <li>Australia: Sebago (the common dirty brushed potatoes you see everywhere)</li>
                    <li>US: Russet (also known as Idaho potatoes)</li>
                    <li>UK: Maris Piper or King Edward</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Vinegar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, we have to cut our fries. A neat little crispy fries trick you may not have seen before: use a serrated knife to cut the potatoes.
                Though not visible to the eye, it makes the surface rougher therefore creating more surface area to crisp up = crispier fries!</li>
            <li>Keep cut fries in water to prevent them from browning as you continue cutting. No soaking time is actually required. A simple rinse
                followed by simmering the potatoes in vinegar water takes care of this for us.</li>
            <li>Once all the fries are cut, place in a colander then rinse under tap water for 15 – 20 seconds. This is the first step to remove
                excess sugars from the surface of the potatoes (more on the “why” of this below, but in short it’s to aid crispiness – of course!).
                Meanwhile, the insides remain untouched by water so they’ll cook up nice and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes are rinsed, place them in a pot with cold tap water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil on high heat then immediately
                turn down to low so the surface is barely rippling. Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Use a spider or large slotted spoon to remove the potatoes from the water into a colander. Then carefully spread the potatoes out on
                two tea towel-lined trays to steam dry for 5 minutes. No need to pat them dry, the residual heat will do the job for us.</li>
            <li>Use a heavy-based, large pot that is at least 10 cm / 4″ deep. We need:
                <ul>
                    <li>3 cm / 1.2″ of oil (1 litre/quart for the pictured 24cm / 10″ pot). It’s barely deep-frying, it’s more like shallow-frying!</li>
                    <li>7 cm / 2.8″ headroom above the surface of the oil for safety purposes as the oil bubbles up quite a lot when we fry. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>FRYING
                <ol>
                    <li>Separate the cooked potatoes into 3 even piles (batches). We will be doing Fry #1 in three batches in a 24 cm / 10″ pot.
                        If your pot is larger or smaller, adjust the number of batches accordingly so all the fries in one batch can float in a
                        single layer in the oil.</li>
                    <li>Add 1/3 of Batch #1 – Using a spider or slotted spoon, carefully add 1/3 of the first batch into the oil.</li>
                    <li>Wait 10 seconds then add another 1/3 of batch #1. Pausing before adding more fries is important to ensure the oil doesn’t
                        bubble up too high. Use this time to load up, ready to add more fries.</li>
                    <li>Wait 10 seconds, then add the final 1/3 of Batch #1.</li>
                    <li>Once all the fries are in, start the timer and fry for 50 seconds, moving the fries around once or twice.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Remove the fries from the oil using a slotted spoon and spread onto a paper towel-lined tray in a single layer. They will be pale
                and not yet crispy. Carry out Fry #1 for the remaining two batches using the same staggered approach (ie. 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3) within each batch.
                Ensure the oil is back at 205°C/400°F before starting each batch. Then cool all the fries for 30 minutes on some paper towel-lined trays.</li>
            <li>After cooling the fries, heat the oil to 205°C/400°F again. Now fry half all the french fries for 4 minutes until they are a gorgeous
                golden colour and wonderfully crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon into a large paper towel-lined bowl then repeat with the remaining fries.</li>
            <li>Now that your fries are done, sprinkle with salt or your favourite fries seasoning while hot so the salt sticks. Toss, then serve!
                Remember, these fries will stay crispy for more than 15 minutes, though of course they are best consumed piping hot!</li>
