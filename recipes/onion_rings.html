        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These crispy Onion Rings are delicious as an appetizer or in a <a href="./hamburger.html">hamburger</a>.
            They’re made restaurant-style, which means they’re crispy on the outside,tender on the inside, and seasoned to perfection.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Larger onions</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>White vinegar</li>
            <li>Sour cream</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour </li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat with about an inch of oil.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the milk with the vinegar and let it sit for 5 minutes. Whisk in the sour cream.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Slice and separate the onion rings and dip each ring in the sour cream mixture, followed by the flour (using a fork will keep your hands clean).
                Repeat by dipping the rings a second time in the milk mixture and flour. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining onion rings.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot enough for the onion rings to sizzle (375˚F on a thermometer), add them in a single layer (3-4 at a time) and fry for
                3 to 4 minutes, flipping halfway, or until the outside is crispy and light golden brown. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate.</li>
        </ol>
